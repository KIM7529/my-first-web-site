<p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle was a short-lived tropical cyclone that passed over North 
Carolina before tracking out to sea. The seventh named storm of the 2007 Atlantic 
hurricane season, Gabrielle developed as a subtropical cyclone on September 8 about 
385 miles (620 km) southeast of Cape Lookout, North Carolina. Unfavorable wind shear 
impacted the storm for much of its duration, although a temporary decrease in the shear
allowed the cyclone to become a tropical storm. On September 9, it made landfall at 
Cape Lookout National Seashore in North Carolina with winds of 60 mph (97 km/h).</p>
