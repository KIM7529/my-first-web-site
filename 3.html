<h2>JavaScript</h2>
<body>
    <p>The JavaScript reference serves as a repository of facts about the JavaScript language.
    <br>The entire language is described here in detail. As you write JavaScript code, you'll 
    <br>refer to these pages often (thus the title "JavaScript reference").
        <img src="javascript.jpg" width="500px">
    <br>The JavaScript language is intended to be used within some larger environment, be it a 
    <br>browser, server-side scripts, or similar. For the most part, this reference attempts to
    <br>be environment-agnostic and does not target a web browser environment.</p>
